Title: Funding

I was previously directly supported, as a PI, by a [National Science Foundation](http://nsf.gov)
[Postdoctoral Reseach Fellowship in Biology](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503622),
which ran until July, 2016.  You can read more

From the abstract:
The main goal of this project is to investigate the underlying genetic architecture
associated with bark thickness as a fire-adapted phenotype in four, economically-important,
closely-related, species of pines with a range along the eastern and southeastern United States.
Using next-generation, genotype-by-sequencing approaches, the study will determine the degree
to which the genetic architecture for this complex trait is shared across natural ranges and multiple
evolutionary time scales, and how the variability observed can inform breeding plans to minimize the
negative financial impact that bark mass has on the forest industry. This research will 1) provide new
genomic resources for non-model species; 2) augment existing plant genomic resources; 3) address fundamental
principles in evolutionary biology; and 4) serve to inform and improve breeding programs and land
management initiatives.
