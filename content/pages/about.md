Title: About

**Now**  

I am currently a postdoc in [Andrew Eckert](http://eckertlab.blogspot.com)'s lab at 
[Virginia Commonwealth University](http://www.vcu.edu).  We are working 
on all things ecological genomics, but I'm funded specfically by NSF as a 
Postdoctoral Research Fellow to work on uncovering the genetic architecture 
of fire-adapted bark thickness in south-eastern USA _Pinus_ species.  You can 
read more about this grant on the [Funding](funding.html) page.

**Then**

I graduated from [Maria Rivera](http://riveralab.bio.vcu.edu)'s lab in 
May 2013 with a Ph.D. in [Integrative Life Sciences](http://www.vcu.edu/lifesci/phd/).  My 
dissertation was focused on uncovering relationships between bacterial 
communities and their environment using a new technique we are calling 
_Phylometagenomics_ coupled with other best-of-breed methods in the field.  We 
[published](http://www.biogeosciences.net/9/2177/2012/bg-9-2177-2012.html) one of the chapters 
of my dissertation, and there is more to come, including a fully-flushed out 
treatment of the Bayesian analysis routine used in this paper.  We were also involved in the 
Euglenozoa arm of the [Assembling the Tree of Life](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5129) 
project funded by NSF, but lack of adequate data and project management (to no fault of our own) has 
hampered our ability to elucidate any relationships among these organisms.

**Back then**  

From 2007 to 2008, I was a Master's student in the [VCU Bioinformatics](http://www.vcu.edu/csbc/bioinformatics/) 
program.  My advisor was [Paul Fawcett](http://www.vcu.edu/csbc/Fawcett/), and we worked on some cool microarray analysis software, 
[_SLEDRIDE_](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sledride/?source=directory), for my 
project.  We were scooped, but it was an excellent learning experience.  I graduated in August 2008 
with a Professional Science Masters (M.Bin.) degree.

**Way back then**

I graduated from [Gettysburg College](http://www.gettysburg.edu) in 1999, after spending most of my senior year as a 
graduate/Optometry student at the [Pennsylvania College of Optometry](http://www.salus.edu/optometry/) as part of a 3-4 
program. I quickly realized that Optometry was not the direction in which I wanted to take my life, despite years of 
planning and undergraduate acceleratory hammering.  I was able to secure an entry-level Information Technology job with 
[Bentley Systems](http://www.bentley.com) in 1999, and worked there until 2001.  I was promoted twice in that time, from 
Systems Analyst to Senior Systems Analyst to Systems Administrator.  I loved working there, but cha  nges 
in my personal life brought me to Richmond, VA in the winter of 2002.  After completing MCSA and MCSE certificaitons, 
I worked in various senior, IT roles (e.g., the now defunct Circuit City, [Infineon](http://www.infineon.com), and 
[VCU Health System](http://www.vcuhealth.org)) for the next 
five years until 2007.  After working for these and other companies, as both salaried employee and consultant, 
I came to the realization that I could do more with my life and contribute back to society in other ways.  I quit IT, 
had a retirement party, and continued down the path of academia.
