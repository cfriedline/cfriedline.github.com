### Now

I'm currently Director of Bioinformatics and Information Technology at a startup
biomedical technology company in Richmond, VA, where we specialize in using cutting edge
molecular techniques, large data sets, and algorithms to inform clinical management of
patients with
complex conditions. For a small company, we have excellent computing capability
including a >200 CPU HPC cluster (>1TB RAM) currently supporting
[SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com),
[Docker](https://www.docker.com), [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org) and
[Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) backed by >200TB of spinning disk. Our
analysis code is written and developed largely using
[Jupyter/IPython](http://www.jupyter.org) on the excellent
[JupyterLab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab) platform.

### Just a bit ago

I was postdoc in [Andrew Eckert](http://eckertlab.blogspot.com)'s lab at
[Virginia Commonwealth University](http://www.vcu.edu).  We are working
on all things ecological genomics, but I'm funded specfically by NSF as a
Postdoctoral Research Fellow to work on uncovering the genetic architecture
of fire-adapted bark thickness in south-eastern USA _Pinus_ species.  You can
read more about this grant on the [Funding](funding.html) page. Immedialy following
that postdoc, I stayed on in Andrew's lab to start work on
[this NSF-funded project](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1442486).

### Then

I graduated from [Maria Rivera](http://riveralab.bio.vcu.edu)'s lab in
May 2013 with a Ph.D. in [Integrative Life Sciences](http://www.vcu.edu/lifesci/phd/).  My
dissertation was focused on uncovering relationships between bacterial
communities and their environment using a new technique we are calling
_Phylometagenomics_ coupled with other best-of-breed methods in the field.  We
[published](http://www.biogeosciences.net/9/2177/2012/bg-9-2177-2012.html) one of the chapters
of my dissertation, and there is more to come, including a fully-flushed out
treatment of the Bayesian analysis routine used in this paper.  We were also involved in the
Euglenozoa arm of the [Assembling the Tree of Life](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5129)
project funded by NSF, but lack of adequate data and project management (to no fault of our own) has
hampered our ability to elucidate any relationships among these organisms.

### Back then

From 2007 to 2008, I was a Master's student in the [VCU Bioinformatics](http://www.vcu.edu/csbc/bioinformatics/)
program.  My advisor was [Paul Fawcett](http://www.vcu.edu/csbc/Fawcett/), and we worked on some cool microarray analysis software,
[_SLEDRIDE_](http://sourceforge.net/projects/sledride/?source=directory), for my
project.  We were scooped, but it was an excellent learning experience.  I graduated in August 2008
with a Professional Science Masters (M.Bin.) degree.

### Way back then

I graduated from [Gettysburg College](http://www.gettysburg.edu) in 1999, after spending most of my senior year as a
graduate/Optometry student at the [Pennsylvania College of Optometry](http://www.salus.edu/optometry/) as part of a 3-4
program. I quickly realized that Optometry was not the direction in which I wanted to take my life, despite years of
planning and undergraduate acceleratory hammering.  I was able to secure an entry-level Information Technology job with
[Bentley Systems](http://www.bentley.com) in 1999, and worked there until 2001.  I was promoted twice in that time, from
Systems Analyst to Senior Systems Analyst to Systems Administrator.  I loved working there, but changes
in my personal life brought me to Richmond, VA in the winter of 2002.  After completing MCSA and MCSE certificaitons,
I worked in various senior IT roles (e.g., the now defunct Circuit City, [Infineon](http://www.infineon.com), and
[VCU Health System](http://www.vcuhealth.org)) for the next
five years until 2007.  After working for these and other companies, as both salaried employee and consultant,
I came to the realization that I could do more with my life and contribute back to society in other ways.  I quit IT,
had a retirement party, and continued down the path of academia.
