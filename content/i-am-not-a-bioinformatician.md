Title: I am not a bioinformatician
Tags: bnfo, facepalm, rant

Ok, so I suppose this requires some clarification. Last 
week, I attended [PAGXXII](http://www.intlpag.org) in San Diego. 
Overall, it was a good experience.  Given that I have no choice 
of going for the next two years, as a condition of my 
NSF fellowship, I'll be looking forward to some sun 
next January.  This being my first major conference as a 
postdoc, I was characteristically terrible at 
networking, probably talked too much at the bar each night, 
and spent too much time sitting in meetings rather than 
building scientific collaborations in the sunshine.

I went to lots of talks at PAG that focused on, well, what 
I would call "bean-counting."  You've been there, yearning 
for biological or evolutionary insight from the newly 
assembled or annotated genome, only to sit there 
though talk after talk of "The N50 was..." or "At 100X coverage 
we managed to assemble 14M contigs..."  While these data 
are no doubt valuable to the scientific process, it does 
fall a little flat after awhile.  Give me some description 
of a novel pathway, what makes your study system special, how 
can this be applied to a more broad class of organisms, something, 
dear god something, other than N50 and contig number and length 
distributions.

With that mini-rant out of the way, I had a chance encounter 
with a scientist from a well-known lab, studying some of the 
same trees as we do, who earlier in the week, saw me talking 
to another member of his lab.  I was sitting at the bar, having 
a snack before the banquet, and he said something like, "I saw 
you talking to so-and-so, and you're the 'bioinformatician' 
working with Andrew, right?"  Just then, I died a little inside. 
In fact, the same thing happened at the NSF awardee meeting in the 
fall, when the program officer told a room full of other awardees
(read: professional and admirable scientists) that I was a 
bioinformatician, and that my proposal was funded partly 
because I brought a different level of experience to the 
plant genomics community (the addressing of fundamental 
evolutionary questions and specific, testable hypotheses, 
notwithstanding, of course).

Here's my perspective.  Yes, I used to do lots of fancy IT. 
Yes, I know my way around several operating systems and know 
a few programming languages. Yes, I have a masters in bioinformatics 
in addition to a Ph.D. Yes, I write code every day. Yes, I write 
this code (usually) to analyze biological data.  So, why am I not a 
bioinformatician, then?  Why don't I just shut up and stop being 
such an elitist?  As it turns out, the former question is much easier 
to address than the latter (snicker).  Let me say first, before anyone 
gets their feelings hurt, that **there is nothing wrong with being a 
bioinformatician**.  

The venerable Wikipedia defines 
[bioinformatics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics) as: "an 
interdisciplinary scientific field that develops methods for storing, 
retrieving, organizing and analyzing biological data."  You can read 
the wiki, if you desire, but the short of it is (at least for me) is 
that I am interested in the **science** of the system, not simply the 
techniques (developed either by me or someone else) used in the analysis 
process.  I want to understand the **biology**, and that happens to come 
along, these days, with the (un)fortunate burden of huge data sets.

To me, a bioinformatician is someone who works in conjunction with a PI 
(I do include myself in this category) and provides a service (sometimes 
even a valuable one), where that service is needed.  Bioinformaticians 
tend to prioritize data generation and methodology execution higher than 
biological insight. They are the "Methods" section rather than the 
"Discussion" section.  It's also been my (probably extremely 
rare and biased) experience here at VCU that 
the *bioinformaticians* with whom I have had the pleasure to 
interact, either (or in some combination):

1. Don't know what they're doing (which is bad)
1. Think they know what they're doing (which is worse)
1. Provide inadequate customer service (in a service-oriented role)
1. Don't play well with others (read: huge ego)
1. Overstay their welcome and/or overestimate their contributions

So, if I'm not a bioinformatician, then what (other than elitist, jerk, etc.)?  
What do I tell my in-laws, friends, relatives, or the occasional stranger at a bar?  
Usually, I say that **I am a scientist**, further probing leads me into **evolutionary 
biologist** (where my main passions lie) or **computational biologist** (for 
practicality).  If I really don't care to talk at that moment, I'll even fall back 
on **postdoc**, but people either don't know what that is, or think it has 
something to do with a Ph.D., but upon further inspection of my person, let's face it, 
doesn't often jive with stretched ears and ample tattoos.

So, yeah, to sum it up: I neither have said nor ever will say that I am 
*bioinformatician* (and you shouldn't, either).
