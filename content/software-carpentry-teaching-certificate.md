Title: Software Carpentry certified!
Tags: swcarpentry, teaching

This is a little late in getting up here, achievment having
been unlocked last May, but better late than never.

I'm very proud to be part of this
[organization](http://www.software-carpentry.ort), and I'm looking forward to
teaching more workshops in 2015.
