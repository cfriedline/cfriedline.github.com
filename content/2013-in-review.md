Title: 2013 in review
Tags: field

Now that the chaos of the end of the year is behind me, I thought I'd 
take a step back and look at my progress (such as it was).  Lots of lessons 
were learned this year, not just scientifically either.  Navigating the 
inter-state bureaucracy when it comes to collecting samples is, to put it 
nicely, slow and inconsistent.  More on that later.

#Sampling trip #1 (a.k.a., the trip that never should have been)

Leaving my wife at home with our daughter while I was out in the field 
was a situation that I really wanted to avoid.  So, when the opportunity 
came up for Kristin to have time off at a time when I could get into the field, 
we both jumped at it.  As husbands sometimes do, I made all of the camping 
reservations for our trip without consulting anyone.  The trip was to span 
a nice swathe of land across the southeast, taking us from Richmond, VA
to South Carolina, Florida, Alabama, and Georgia.  In my mind, this 
was reasonable.  Hell, I was even building just travel days so our 
baby daughter didn't have to spend 12+ hours in the car.  I care.  I 
really do.  Most of our camping was going to be done in our pop-up, 
towed lovingly by our trusty SAAB.  We had heat, water, power, and all 
shelter - we were golden.

The trip stared off innocently enough, and we made it our first night stay 
without issue, if not somewhat late at night, at 
[The Oaks](http://www.reserveamerica.com/camping/The_Oaks/r/campgroundDetails.do?parkId=261505&contractCode=ELS2&chkAg=y&clCr=y) 
in South Carolina.  The next day was a drive to FL to stay over at 
[Rainbow Springs](http://www.floridastateparks.org/rainbowsprings/)
State Park.  Again - no issues.  Got in, set up camp, dinner, some wine.  You know, 
roughing it.  The following day was to be the first day of sampling.  I was ready.  

Unfortunately, the system (read: the man) wasn't.  Armed with not a single 
scientific permit (because for sure we didn't need one and for sure a hard copy 
of my NSF grant would suffice), I was either denied access to any state park I 
tried as well as chased from two National Forest sites.  Did I mention that 
this day was also the first day of the government shutdown?  With my head 
hung low, back to the campsite I headed.  Because we are both of solid German stock, 
we kept what was to be the daily itinerary of waking, sampling, packing, and driving 
(minus, of course, the sampling).  Our next stop in FL was a KOA in Perry, but I had a 
couple of hours worth of driving from Rainbow Springs, so I did what all good Americans 
do while driving: make lots of frantic phone calls.  I called the FL state park offices in 
Tallahassee, The Alabama Department of Conservation of Natural Resources, and the Georgia 
Department of Natural Resources.  Telling my story to endless chains of assistants was 
trying, but I eventually was able to get my hands on a last minute permit (by email) t
sample in AL.  GA would have to wait, though the extremely helpful staff there (literally, 
not sarcastically) did manage to get me a rushed permit, but it ended up being too late.

Sampling in AL was great - we had beautiful weather, the 
[Frank Jackson](http://www.alapark.com/FrankJackson/) State Park was completely accommodating, 
and (as I said earlier), I was ready.  However, I grossly underestimated the amount of 
time sampling would take me, especially in dense forest.  The goal was to sample needles and 
make other measurements (DBH, height, and bark thickness) for 25 trees.  Finding the trees was 
the easy part.  I could do the measurements in about 2.5 minutes.  Getting the needles 
with a [Big Shot](http://www.sherrilltree.com/Professional-Gear/BIGshot), however, 
was the most challenging part, taking my 2.5 minutes/tree up to sometimes 20 before 
I could move on.  Given that math, I realized I would going to be at this for a long 
time (and not just that day, but more like on the scale of years) before it was all 
said and done.  Starting late that first day, I worked until dark, and nearly finished.  
Nearly, because, well, this happened:

Kristin was cleaning a wine glass, the baby was having some lunch, and bang!  Wine glass shatters 
off the faucet of the camper, Kristin's thumb goes right into it, completely severs a nerve, and 
bleeds like a M-F'er.  A frantic phone call and a trip to the ER (in Opp, AL!) to follow.  Thankfully, 
Kristin, a CNRA, is well-connected.  The next day, I finished sampling, and we drove 16 hours from Florala to 
Richmond so she could be seen by an expert and schedule up some surgery.

All in all - the trip was, well, basically, a fail.  I was able to get only 25 trees sampled (I anticipated 250).  I did, 
however, learn some valuable lessons:

1. Make sure to allow enough time for sampling and travel.
1. Make sure to obtain any and all permits, even if you might not need them.
1. Carry platic wine glasses in the camper.
1. Don't bring your wife and baby on a 10-day camping/field expedition.
1. If you do bring wife and/or baby, make sure to consult wife ahead of time.

#Getting permits

Getting permits for sampling turned out to be more of a chore than I imagined.  Seems like so much 
of science, really, and at some point I suppose I'll stop getting surprised by it.  For those of you 
who are reading and planning on embarking on a scientific sampling endeavor (outside of CA, where, according 
to Andrew, you can pretty much sample anyting as long as you're not taking seeds), save yourself a 
lot of heartache and contact the states/national offices before you go.  This will save time, hassle, 
and jailtime - trust me.

The process is as follows (roughly):

1. Search for the state parks you want to visit online
1. Navigate an unpublished and inexplicably long phone tree
1. If you want find a phone number, find an email
1. If you can't find an email, call the park reservation line
1. Once you find the right person, find out what they need from you.  In my case, my grant application, approval letter, 
and a page or two of description did the trick
1. Submit apps and wait (up to a month or more).  

Most of the approved permits also come with some strings attached.  For some states, I'm required to renew early/often, 
provide detailed reports, and/or speak at their meetings about my project.  Most places require that I give 
them advanced notcie of when I'm going to be at their location.  Luckily, it seems like they're cool with approximations and 
it really does come in handly when the park is expecting your visit.  Usually, they also want to know what sites you plan 
on visiting rather than, say, "I'd really like a permit to visit any state park in FL for the next year."  For national parks, 
it's a little more complicated.  In my case, I submitted an application for the entire region 8 which covers any site I might 
want to visit in the southeast.
