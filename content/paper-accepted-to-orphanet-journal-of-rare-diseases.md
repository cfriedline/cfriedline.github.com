Tags: publications, microbiome

Jeremy Gilbreath's paper, _A Core Microbiome Associated with the Peritoneal Tumors of 
Pseudomyxoma Peritonei_, on which I am an author, has been accepted to [Orphanet Journal of 
Rare Diseases](http://www.ojrd.com).  Jeremy was my roommate at [MOLE](http://molevol.mbl.edu) and 
[STAMPS](http://stamps.mbl.edu) in 2011, and I'm proud to collaborate with him and the others.  
Congrats, Jeremy!
