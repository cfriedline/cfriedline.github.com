Title: Winter school in Weggis
Tags: teaching, travel, evolution, ipython

This is just a place-holder for now, largely to get myself moving on writing all of this up. Until then, here are some of the basics

* I was one of five instructors for the [Bioinformatics for Adaptation Genomics](http://www.adaptation.ethz.ch/education/winter-school-2015.html): Adaptation genomics in the realm of Next-Generation Sequencing data analysis course, held in Weggis, CH from March 1 to March 7, 2015.
* My day-long [lecture and exercises](https://github.com/cfriedline/congen2015) focused on evolutionary genetics (genomics) and methods for detecting assocations, among genotypes, traits, and evironments.
*   My wife went, too!  
*   The trip was wholly awesome.

More later, I promise.
